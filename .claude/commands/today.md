description: Show my overdue and upcoming Linear tasks
---

Look at my Linear issues assigned to me and create two lists:

## Overdue Tasks
Issues where the due date has already passed (before today).

## Tasks Due Soon (< 7 days)
Issues with a due date within the next 7 days.

For each task, show:
- Issue identifier and title
- Due date
- Current status
- Priority (if set)

Sort each list by due date (most urgent first).
